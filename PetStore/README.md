# rest-assured-example
This repository contains examples with rest-assured framework

To understand what rest-assured is go to this ref http://rest-assured.io

As an example of live RESTful API I use http://petstore.swagger.io/

To generate models for my tests I use https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/blob/master/README.md#online-generators
and https://generator.swagger.io/

To generate JAVA class from JSON I use http://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/

To run tests you need JDK 1.7+
To build it you'll need maven3
